**Hexcap** is an ncurses based hex editor for pcap files written by Andrew McConachie, aka smutt.  It uses the python dpkt library for reading/writing pcap files.

Hexcap has been tested to run on Linux and FreeBSD but any UNIX-like system that supports curses terminal emulation should work.

Hexcap is licensed under the GPLv2.
