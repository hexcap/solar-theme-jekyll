I've put together a new video on generators and masks in hexcap. I'm not going to win any awards for my voice acting on these videos, but hopefully they give people an idea of what's possible with hexcap.

The video can be viewed directly on YouTube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5fgXVapxyQ). Or it's also embedded below. As always, it's probably best to watch it in fullscreen.

As always, check the [man page](/doc/) for more complete descriptions of functionality. This marks the end of my summer and the time I have to spend on hexcap, so I'll be mothballing the project again until school is finished.
