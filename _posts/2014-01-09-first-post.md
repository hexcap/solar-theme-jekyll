First Post!

You gotta start somewhere.  I have been working on hexcap for a few months now in my spare time and it was time I built a website.  Hexcap will continue to be hosted at Github but will also have hexcap.org as a reference point.

To kick off the 0.1 release of hexcap I have:

* Launched hexcap.org (gotta love Jekyll and static HTML markdown)

* Given hexcap a manpage

* Created a TODO list of dream features


If you're curious download the [binary](https://github.com/hexcap/hexcap/blob/master/bin/hexcap?raw=true) for Linux/FreeBSD or fork the Github repository.
