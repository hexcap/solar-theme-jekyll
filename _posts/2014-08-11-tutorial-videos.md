I finally found the time to put together two basic tutorial videos for hexcap. They're embedded below, but the quality is definitely better if you watch them directly on Youtube.

[The first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywldp0vF358) is a brief introduction to basic packet editing in hexcap.

[The second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c63CQ1dLv8) offers some basic instruction in how to transmit and receive packets in hexcap.

As always, check the [man page](/doc/) for more complete descriptions of functionality. The plan now is to make a third video explaining generators and masks.
